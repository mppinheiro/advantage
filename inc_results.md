Estimating true producer advantage in a hunter population

##### Are better Hadza hunters able to advantage their own households in food distributions?

To address that question, I generated a random sample of all income
allocations that could possibly arise from the acquisition and sharing
rates of married Hadza hunters documented by Wood and Marlowe (2013).
The producer advantage of best hunters relative to the average of all
other hunters was then calculated by comparing the incomes from this
representative sample of feasible income allocations.  

 

![**Figure. Producer advantage of best Hadza hunters.** The figure shows
producer advantage index (PAI) values calculated for the households of
best hunters relative to other households on average based on (a)
feasible income allocations sampled from the producer income space
(density plots) and (b) post-sharing acquisition rates only (dashed
lines). Results are shown for the married hunter population (upper
graph) and the full population of male and female producers (lower
graph). The grey area corresponds to the equality zone where incomes
differ by up to 20% in either
direction.](inc_results_files/figure-gfm/plot%20figure-1.png)  

 

##### Results for the hunter population

1.  When comparing the household incomes of **best hunters with other
    hunters on average**, the median PAI is 0.05 (95% CI \[0.04,
    0.05\]), ranging from -0.26 to 0.4. Based on the 20% income
    difference threshold, producer advantage, equality, and producer
    disadvantage arise in 4%, 95%, and 0% of sampled feasible income
    allocations, respectively.

2.  Using the 5th to 95th percentiles of the PAI distribution as the
    range within which true producer advantage most likely falls, it
    follows that the income difference between the households of **best
    hunters vs. other hunters on average** would be anywhere between -9%
    (95% CI \[-9%, -8%\]) and 19% (95% CI \[19%, 20%\]). Therefore, best
    hunters would most likely have limited opportunity to advantage
    their own households even though they provided around 3 times more
    calories to their own households than other hunters on average.

##### Results for the full population

3.  When comparing the household incomes of **best hunters and their
    wives with other male and female producers on average**, the median
    PAI is 0.1 (95% CI \[0.1, 0.1\]), ranging from -0.2 to 0.45. Based
    on the 20% income difference threshold, producer advantage,
    equality, and producer disadvantage arise in 12%, 88%, and 0% of
    sampled feasible income allocations, respectively.

4.  Using the 5th to 95th percentiles of the PAI distribution as the
    range within which true producer advantage most likely falls, it
    follows that the income difference between the households of **best
    hunters and their wives vs. other male and female producers on
    average** would be anywhere between -2% (95% CI \[-2%, -2%\]) and
    24% (95% CI \[24%, 24%\]). Therefore, best hunters and their wives
    would most likely have limited opportunity to advantage their own
    households even though they provided around 1.7 times more calories
    to their own households than other male and female producers on
    average.

##### Results for both populations

5.  The mean PAI was 0.1 (SD = 0.08) for the full population and 0.05
    (SD = 0.09) for the married hunter population. A Welch two-samples
    t-test showed that the difference was statistically significant,
    t(1.978^{4}) = 47, p \< .0001. However, the mean PAI difference
    between the full and married hunter populations was 0.06 (95% CI
    \[0.05, 0.06\]) and the shared area of the density curves estimated
    by the overlapping index is 0.74 (95% CI \[0.72, 0.75\]). Thus,
    while there are statistically significant differences in producer
    advantage estimates derived for the married hunter and the full
    population, these differences are of little practical significance
    and the estimates are overall very similar to each other in both
    scenarios.
