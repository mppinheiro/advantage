### Estimating true producer advantage in a hunter population
This folder contains the R files used to implement the method for deriving producer advantage estimates from the income space of a population of producers.

- The main R code defines the population parameters, generates sharing matrices and income vectors, and calculates the producer advantage index (PAI) together with a set of relevant statistics.
- The R Markdown code generates the figure and details the results.
- The data files generated from the main code include the PAI distribution for the population of married hunters and the full population together with associated statistics; an additional file includes the statistics for comparing both distributions.
